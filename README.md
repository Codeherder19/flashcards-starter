## Technologies Used:
- *JavaScript*
- *Github*
- *Google Chrome - Developer Console*
- *Terminal CLI*

## Instructions for running/viewing the project:
Unfortunately, this project is incomplete, and the flash cards game is unplayable in the terminal command line. I ran out of time. I believe I wrote enough unit tests for my classes and that all of my other classes are built correctly. I just figured out too late that I need to access my index.js file and it was too late for me to finish the last bit of code to get the game fully functional. I completed an extension of using a project board for this project and had plans to create my own data set but those are moot given the fact I did not complete a basic finished project.

### Deploy Links
[Find the repo here](https://github.com/Codeherder19/flashcards-starter.git)

### Future Additions
1. First and foremoest, complete the project.
2. Add other data sets for more games of flash cards/trivia. 
3. Add the choice of repeating the round to get a better score or starting a new round with a new deck of cards.

### WINS
1. Writing unit tests and getting a grasp on the unfamiliar expect syntax as opposed to assert syntax.

### Challenges
1. Understanding beforeEach and how to set that up in your describe block. 
2. Trying to understand index.js, util.js, data.js and what's happening with these new files and code snippets I've never seen before. 
3. Understanding how to integrate the terminal CLI with my class js files I had created so the game would run, which I still do not understand.
